## 🤍 Why HerSpace?

Because women deserve more than productivity apps.  
They deserve tools that meet them **where they are** — in their emotions, in motherhood, in transition, in burnout, in healing.

**HerSpace** is not just an app.  
It is a **daily ritual, a mirror, and a companion** for the inner journey.
